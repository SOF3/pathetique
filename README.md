# Pathetique
An object-oriented path manipulation library in PHP.

The API and implementation is largely based on the [rust `std::path` implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d8bdb3fdcbd88eb16e1a6669236122c41ed2aed3/src/libstd/path.rs).

(I was listening to Tchaikovsky's Pathetique when I wrote this)
